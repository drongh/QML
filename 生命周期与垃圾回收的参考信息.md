## A deep dive into QML memory management internals

* QML is a declarative language used to describe user interfaces
    * hierarchy and relationship of UI elements/objects

* Javascript can be embedded to implement UI logic

* QML object types are implemented in C++
    * Non-visual QML elements derive directly from QObject
    * Visual QML elements derive from QQuickItem(which is derived from QObject)
    * E.g. a "Rectangle{}" is implemented by C++ class QQuickRectangle

* The QML source describes how to assemble a tree of QObjects

* Methods to create QML objects
    * Static:
        * QQuickView::setSource(QUrl("..."))
        * QQmlApplicationEngine::load(QUrl("..."))
    * Dynamic:
        * Loader
        * Qt.createComponent()/component.createObject(parent)
    * All these methods create a tree of QML objects
    * An object that gets destroyed will also (recursively) destroy its children
        * The same mechanism as in Qt
    * No garbage collection involved (for the QML objects itself)!

* QML properties
    * Rectangle { property int foo; property var bar }
    * Properties defined in QML source need to
        * be stored somewhere
        * integrate with the rest of the metaobject system
    * QQmlVMEMetaObject takes care of that
    * typed properties (non-var) are stored on the process heap (QQmlVMEVariant objects)
    * var properties are stored as QV4::Values in an QV4::Array which resides on the JS heap
    * This will change with Qt5.6
        * QQmlVMEVariant weighs in at 8*sizeof(void*) + sizeof(int) => 36/72 bytes
        * Everything will be stored in a QV4::Value (8 bytes)
    * What happens to a property when its object is deleted?
        * The parts allocated on the process heap are directly deleted with the object
        * The parts stored on the JS-side are orphaned and left for garbage collection
    * What happens to a QML object stored in a var property?
        * Still cleaned up via the QObject hierarchy, no GC

* Is the GC ever collecting QObjects?
    * Yes, if an object has
        * QQmlEngine::JavaScriptOwnership
        * no parent
        * no remaining JavaScript references

* Will the GC ever collect a visible QObject?
    * No, the visual parent will keep its visual children alive

* QML objects
    * are allocated from the process heap
    * deallocated via delete/deleteLater

* Children are cleaned up via the Qt object hierarchy

* QML allows you to control the life-time of objects
    * (typically) no garbage collection involved

* Make use of it!
    * Loader/dynamic object creation
    * Unload elements no longer needed
    * Make sure to call .destroy() on dynamically created components

* Javascript
    * JavaScript in QML can be used in
        * property bindings
        * signal handlers
        * custom methods
        * standalone
    * The code for the various JavaScript types is written in C++
    * Instances are allocated from a separate garbage collected JS heap

* The only way to deallocate JS objects is to run the GC

* How dose the GC work?
    * Triggered eigher through
        * an allocation (depending on usage metrics)
        * manually (JS/C++)
    * Runs in the main thread, blocks the application
    * The implementation can be found in QV4::MemoryManager

* Objectives of the GC
    * The GC is freeing unused objects from the JS heap

* Should I manually trigger the GC?
    * In general: no
    * Exceptions to the rule:
        * the application is idle (and no one is looking)
    * after unloading a large QML component
        * Ensure to pass through the eventloop once, before calling gc()
        * Try to run malloc_trim(0) to encourage malloc to give memory back to the OS

* Javascript objects
    * are allocated from a separate Javascript heap
        * with the exception of large items
    * deallocated only via the GC
        * also large items are gc'd

* The GC is triggered either
    * through utilisation metrics
    * manually

* Conclusion
    * A conceptual understanding how QML memory management works
        * QML: allows you to control the life-time of objects
        * Javascript: No direct control over object life-time
    * Memory management has improved throughout Qt5
        * Use an up to date version of Qt
            * if you can't, be aware of version specific behaviour
            * E.g. avoid memory peaks with a Qt < 5.5
    * For memory constrained environments
        * Less is more (especially for delegates)
        * Plan for dynamic object loading/unloading
        * Limit the ammount of Javascript

**注意该整理文第一句与上面的内容可能存在一定矛盾，也有可能是因为理解不到位而感觉有矛盾，为避免内容遗漏，依然在这里保留**

## QML tricks and treats

* the various object-like entities' runtime ownership -- there are:
    * QML side objects (QtObject and Item instances), garbage collected by the QML engine
    * JS objects managed by the JS runtime
    * (the strangest thing) "var" properties which are "not QML objects (and certainly not Javascript object eigher)", quoting the docs
        * note: whether a QObject's lifetime is managed by the QML engine, can also be set on a per-object basis manually (see docs on QqmlEngine::ObjectOwenership())
